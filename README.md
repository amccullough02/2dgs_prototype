# 2DGS Prototype
This repository contains files used for the 2DGS (two-dimensional gravity simulator) prototype. The point of this
prototype is to provide a baseline of functionality and to solve potential time-consuming problems in advance of main
development.

## Progress Tracking
To keep things very simple I won't be employing any high-level methodology to this prototype, as the point is to quickly
hack together solutions and discard anything that doesn't work.
